**How to change the profile picture?**

Go to manage accounts and click on your picture. Now select another one from your Gallery.

**How does the address book integration work?**

sunehaG neither uploads contacts from your address book to your server nor fills your address book with unnecessary contacts from your online contact list. If you manually add a Internet Access ID to your phones address book sunehaG will use the name and the profile picture of this contact.

To make the process of adding Contacts to your address book easier you can click on the profile picture in the contact details within sunehaG. This will start an "add to address book" intent with the Internet Access ID as the payload. This doesn't require Conversations to have write permissions on your address book but also doesn't require you to copy/paste the ID from one app to another.
